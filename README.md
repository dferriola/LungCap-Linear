# LungCap-Linear
Simple Linear Regression with LungCap data


The dataset I chose for this activity was the LungCapData that is made available on this webpage http://www.statslectures.com/index.php/r-stats-datasets from Marin Stat Lectures. This dataset is in regards to lung capacity and other variables. 

This dataset has 725 observations with 6 variables. The six variables are in regards to lung capacity, age, height, smoking status, gender, and whether they are caesarean.  For this simple linear regression model I would like to observe whether age and lung capacity have a linear relationship. Then I will observe whether height and lung capacity have a linear relationship along with smoking status. The regression problem we have is predicting lung capacity given age, height, and smoking status. The predictor variables are the height in relation to the Lung capacity (response) and for my second the age (predictor) with the lung capacity (response). The smoking status is just colored in order to visualize where it falls in this linear relationship.
